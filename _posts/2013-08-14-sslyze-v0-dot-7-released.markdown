A new version of [SSLyze][sslyze-gh] is now available. SSLyze is a Python tool that can analyze the SSL configuration of a server by connecting to it.


### Changelog

* Complete rewrite of the OpenSSL wrapper as a [C extension][nassl-gh]
   * SSLyze is now statically linked with the latest version of OpenSSL instead of using the system's (potentially outdated/broken) OpenSSL library
    * All of SSLyze's features are now available on all supported platforms (including SSL 2.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2)
    * Scans are slightly faster
    * Python 2.6 is no longer supported
* Support for StartTLS FTP, POP, IMAP, LDAP and "auto". See --starttls
* Support for OCSP Stapling. See --certinfo
* Other various improvements that results in SSLyze being more stable/robust


### Packages

SSLyze requires Python 2.7; the supported platforms are Windows 7 32/64 bits, 
Linux 32/64 bits and OS X 64 bits.
SSLyze is statically linked with OpenSSL 1.0.1e. For this reason, the easiest 
way to run SSLyze is to download one the following pre-compiled packages:
