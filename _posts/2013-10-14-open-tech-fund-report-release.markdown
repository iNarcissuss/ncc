Over the past year, iSEC Partners has worked with the [Open Technology
Fund](https://www.opentechfund.org/) on several of their supported projects.
OTF funds projects that develop open and accessible technologies promoting
human rights and open societies. Some of the projects they support that we've
been able to work on are [Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/)'
RedPhone and TextSecure, [Commotion](https://commotionwireless.net/), and
[GlobaLeaks](https://globaleaks.org/), among others.

We consider ourselves very fortunate to be able to work on projects that are
both very technically interesting and helping make the world a better place.
Projects that OTF supports are used 'in the field' documenting human rights
abuses abroad, provide secure and encrypted communication platforms, and help
document Internet interference and censorship. An extension of our [Liberation
Technology Auditing
Cheatsheet](https://isecpartners.com/blog/2013/february/towards-better-security-when-the-stakes-are-high.aspx),
this work is directly in line with our efforts to make the entire Internet a
more secure place.

In conjunction with these audits, we've also helped OTF perform a review of
their audit process. The goal of this review was to take a look at the
breadth, scope, and coverage of security audits performed on OTF funded
applications to date. We aimed to identify the strengths and shortcomings in
OTF's current process and provide recommendations to improve the breadth of
coverage and to derive greater value in the future. Applicable to both OTF and
other funding agencies in the Liberation Technology and Civil Society
communities, we hope this work inspires more development and more integration
between security professionals and project teams. OTF has published this
review over [on their
website](https://www.opentechfund.org/article/report-how-evaluate-technical-audits-funder)
where you can take a look.
