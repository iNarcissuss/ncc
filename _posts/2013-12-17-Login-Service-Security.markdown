Web application login services are deceptively simple to develop, leading
application developers to repeat the mistakes of the past. Learning from the
best available mitigations for login service vulnerabilities can have a
significant organizational impact in terms of protecting customers and
reducing costs related to account breaches.

This paper explores login service security using attack and defense patterns
and anti-patterns, offering application developers an easy to follow guide to
correctly writing login services. While brute force attacks can't be
completely stopped, they can be drastically reduced using a few simple
techniques.
