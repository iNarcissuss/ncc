Jekyll Tutorial
---------------

Installing Jekyll:

    gem install jekyll


Previewing the site locally at http://localhost:4000 :

    jekyll serve -w


Creating a new blog post
------------------------

__You do not need to have Jekyll installed__ in order to create a new blog post.
However, you will not be able to preview how the post will look on the blog using
Jekyll's serve command.

First you need to fork this repo. Then, you can add your blog post by creating
a .markdown file within the _posts/ folder. The file name should follow this
convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-the-post.markdown.

You can then write your blog post in this file using the Markdown syntax. Feel
free to look at the existing blog posts to get examples.

After writing your post, you can preview it if you have Jekyll installed:

    jekyll serve -w

Once you're ready to post your article, just submit a pull request.
