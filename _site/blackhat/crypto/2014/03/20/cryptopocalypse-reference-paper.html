	<h2>Cryptopocalypse Reference Paper</h2>
    <h6>20 Mar 2014 - Javed Samuel</h6>
</div>

<div lang="en" class="post">
<p>Alex Stamos, Tom Ritter and Javed Samuel presented &quot;Preparing for the
Cryptopocalypse&quot; at Black Hat 2013, looking into the latest breakthroughs in
the academic cryptography community. The original presentation can be
downloaded <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/publications/blob/master/presentations/ritter_samuel_stamos_bh_2013_cryptopocalypse.pdf?raw=true">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today we&#39;re releasing a full whitepaper that provides additional detail and
extensive references which will explain the latest breakthroughs in the
academic cryptography community and look ahead at what practical issues could
arise for popular cryptosystems. Specifically, it focuses on the recent major
developments in discrete mathematics and their potential ability to undermine
our trust in the most basic asymmetric primitives, including RSA.</p>

<p>It explain the basic theories behind RSA and the state-of-the-art in large
numbering factoring, and how several recent papers may point the way to
massive improvements in this area. It also describes some of the mathematics
of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).</p>

<p>The paper then switches to the practical aspects of the doomsday scenario,
and will answer the question &quot;What happens the day after RSA is broken?&quot;
It will point out the many obvious and hidden uses of RSA and related
algorithms and outline how software engineers and security teams can operate
in a post-RSA world. We will also discuss the results of our survey of
popular products and software, and point out the ways in which individuals
can prepare for the &quot;zombie cryptopocalypse&quot;.</p>

<p>The paper provides a detailed list of references to the latest academic papers
related to asymmetric cryptography. In addition, references that discuss the
current level of ECC support in various popular products and software are
included.</p>

<p>The paper can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/publications/blob/master/whitepapers/Cryptopocalypse_Reference_Paper.pdf?raw=true">here</a>.</p>
