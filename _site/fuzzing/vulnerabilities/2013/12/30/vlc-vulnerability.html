	<h2>Fuzzing RTSP to discover an exploitable vulnerability in VLC</h2>
    <h6>30 Dec 2013 - Michael Lynch</h6>
</div>

<div lang="en" class="post">
<p>In this post, we will describe the bug iSEC recently discovered in the Live555
library (CVE-2013-6933, CVE-2013-6934). This yielded a remote code execution
vulnerability in all client and server applications that use the Live555
library, including the popular media player VLC.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Over the past several months, I&#39;ve been using the <a href="http://www.peachfuzzer.com">Peach
framework</a> to create a fuzzer for client
implementations of the RTSP protocol. For those not familiar, RTSP is a
protocol that helps media players stream content. It is a text-based format
that closely resembles HTTP. A simple RTSP request looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">GET_PARAMETER rtsp://streams.isecpartners.com/foo/bar.mp4 RTSP/1.0
CSeq: 9
Content-Type: text/parameters
Session: 12345678
Content-Length: 24

packets_received
jitter
</code></pre></div>
<p>My first two fuzzing targets were QuickTime and VLC, two popular media players
that implement the RTSP protocol. After running 250,000 iterations against
both, QuickTime had a few crashes, though none of them seemed exploitable
(NULL pointer dereferences and the like). The VLC fuzzing yielded something
more interesting.</p>

<h3>Discovery</h3>

<p>The issue is a write access violation when VLC receives an RTSP message of the
following form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> A RTSP/1.0
CSeq: 10
Content-Type: text/parameters
Session: 12345678
Content-Length: 24

packets_received
jitter
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that instead of starting with an RTSP command, the request begins with a
space character. To understand why this causes an access violation, we&#39;ll jump
into VLC&#39;s RTSP handling code, which is actually a 3rd party library called
<a href="http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/">Live555</a>. The vulnerable function is
parseRTSPRequestString(), which begins as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">unsigned i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; resultCmdNameMaxSize-1 &amp;&amp; i &lt; reqStrSize; ++i) {
  char c = reqStr[i];
  if (c == &#39; &#39; || c == &#39;\t&#39;) {
    parseSucceeded = True;
    break;
  }

  resultCmdName[i] = c;
}
resultCmdName[i] = &#39;\0&#39;;
if (!parseSucceeded) return False;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we can begin to see what the problem is. If reqStr begins with a space or
tab character, the function believes that it has parsed the RTSP command
(stored in resultCmdName), when in fact it has parsed nothing. Continuing a
bit further down in the function, we have the following code block:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// [Ed: At this point, variables have the following values:
//  i=0
//  k=1
//  k1=0
//  n=0]
n = 0; k2 = i + 1;
if (i &lt;= k) {
  if (k1 - i &gt; resultURLPreSuffixMaxSize) return False;
  while (k2 &lt;= k1 - 1) resultURLPreSuffix[n++] = reqStr[k2++];
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that the while statement is really equivalent to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">while (k2 &lt;= 0xffffffff) resultURLPreSuffix[n++] = reqStr[k2++];
</code></pre></div>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">while (true) resultURLPreSuffix[n++] = reqStr[k2++];
</code></pre></div>
<p>because k2 is an unsigned int and can never be greater than 0xffffffff.</p>

<h3>Exploitation</h3>

<p>Right now, this is looking very promising. reqStr points to an address on the
heap, and the attacker has a great deal of control over the heap contents
through previous RTSP messages. resultURLPreSuffix points to an address on the
stack. This means that we can overwrite the entire stack with attacker
controlled data. The problem, in the words of security researcher and singer,
M. Cyrus:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../images/miley-wecantstop.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus - &quot;We can&#39;t stop and we won&#39;t stop&quot;"></p>

<p>We can overwrite the stack, but we can&#39;t terminate the write and continue
execution. We&#39;re trapped in this infinite loop until the access violation
occurs when we reach unallocated memory.</p>

<p>At this point, I was stuck. I shared my results with some colleagues
internally and Andreas Junestam, one of iSEC&#39;s Distinguished Security
Engineers, pointed out to me that I could actually use the access violation to
my advantage on Windows. The SEH chain is stored on the stack, so I could
overwrite it and gain code execution when the access violation occurs (Corelan
has a <a href="https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/25/writing-buffer-overflow-exploits-a-quick-and-basic-tutorial-part-3-seh/">nice
tutorial</a>
on how to do this). Within a couple days, I was able to produce a simple proof
of concept that pops calc on Windows XP SP3.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhqWdkUSWXQ"><img src="../../../../../images/youtube_screenshot_vlc.png" alt="VLC proof of concept exploit"></a></p>

<p>I&#39;m cheating a bit by using XP, as every VLC binary for Windows since v.1.0.5
is compiled with DEP, and ASLR. The last version of VLC that was compiled
without ASLR or DEP was v.1.0.5, though that precedes the vulnerability, which
was introduced in v.2.0.0. VLC v.2.1.1 has SafeSEH, DEP, and ASLR enabled, but
I can bypass SafeSEH on XP by jumping to a ROP gadget located within process
memory but outside of loaded modules. I could find no such reliable gadget
available on Vista and above, especially with ASLR enabled.</p>

<h3>Exploitation Vectors</h3>

<h4>Clients</h4>

<p>The video demonstrates three different vectors through which an attacker can
exploit this vulnerability against VLC users. The simplest and most
straightforward vector is to trick a user into manually connecting to a
malicious RTSP server by instructing the victim to select Media &gt; Open Network
Stream and enter the malicious RTSP server address.</p>

<p>A more realistic attack vector is to use .pls files. These are playlist files
that specify a list of files or streams for a media player to play. When a
user installs VLC, it registers itself as the default handler for .pls files.
When VLC opens a .pls file, it will automatically connect to any RTSP streams
specified in the file.</p>

<p>The most practical and frightening attack vector is via the VLC browser
plugin. By default, VLC installs both a Mozilla-based and ActiveX plugin for
all available browsers. This allows any web site that a victim visits to
launch VLC with site-supplied parameters. An attacker can easily use this to
force VLC to connect to a malicious RTSP server and compromise the victim&#39;s
system.</p>

<h4>Servers</h4>

<p>Because the vulnerable code is in a component that both RTSP clients and
servers share in the Live555 library, an attacker can exploit this against
Live555-based RTSP servers as well (including VLC). On Windows platforms, the
attacker can gain remote code execution using a similar method to the client
attack described above. Regardless of the platform, the attacker can perform
denial of service attacks against the server, as the malformed requests will
cause the server to crash.</p>

<h3>Mitigations</h3>

<h4>For end-users</h4>

<p>Upgrade to VLC 2.1.2. To limit your exposure to future vulnerabilities,
consider leaving the VLC plugin disabled in your browser or setting it to
<a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/help-keep-threats-at-bay-with-click-to-play/">Click-to-Play</a>. Do not use VLC to open untrusted .pls files.</p>

<p>For users of other applications that depend on Live555, do not connect to
untrusted RTSP streams until the client is updated to use live.2013.11.29 or
higher.</p>

<h4>For developers that use the Live555 library</h4>

<p>Update your application to the latest version of Live555 as soon as possible.
Urge your users to patch quickly.</p>

<h4>For RTSP server administrators</h4>

<p>Upgrade your RTSP server to use a Live555 library version 2013.11.29 or later.
If you cannot immediately do this, download the latest <a href="http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz">Live555
source</a> and
build the Live555 Proxy Server. Run vulnerable RTSP servers on the back end,
where they are not exposed to malicious RTSP requests. Use the Live555 Proxy
Server as the externally facing server to route RTSP requests to back end RTSP
servers. If the Live555 Proxy Server receives an RTSP request that is
attempting to exploit this vulnerability, it will reject the request with RTSP
400 Bad Request without passing it along to a vulnerable back end server.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>This type of attack should serve as a reminder to users to be very
conservative with their browser plugin configurations. Remember that browser
plugins (meaning Mozilla-based and ActiveX plugins) run in processes outside
of the browser sandbox and are responsible for parsing arbitrary data from
arbitrary web sites. For an application such as VLC, which accepts many <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_Features_Formats/">file
formats</a> and
<a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/Protocols/">protocols</a>, the attack surface is quite
large. Users should enable plugins, not only if they trust the plugin to be
non-malicious, but if they trust it to withstand attacks from <em>any</em> <em>web</em>
<em>site</em> that&#39;s malicious.</p>
