	<h2>iSEC Engages in TrueCrypt Audit</h2>
    <h6>23 Dec 2013 - Tom Ritter</h6>

<div lang="en" class="post">
<p><a href="http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/">Is TrueCrypt audited yet</a>? It&#39;s finally
happening.</p>

<p>For the past few months, there has been much ado about TrueCrypt, the popular
open-source encryption software. Despite being the most widely-used and
simplest encryption software around, the security of its source code and
binaries has come into question. The groundswell of interest from the security
community became a crowdsourced campaign to have TrueCrypt undergo a
professional security audit.</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to announce that iSEC Partners will be participating in
that audit!</p>

<p>iSEC is both honored and fortunate to be part of the security audit of
TrueCrypt. Our task will be to pore over the 70,000+ lines of source code,
helping answer outstanding questions the security community has about the
software&#39;s foundations. iSEC will be focusing on the Windows kernel code, the
bootloader, the filesystem driver, and the areas around this code. Our efforts
will complement the analyses being performed by others on other parts of the
software.</p>

<p>The speed with which funds were raised underscores the importance of this
project to the community. This audit is part of a broad plan to transform
TrueCrypt from a &quot;seems okay&quot; solution into a trusted project with
reproducible, trusted builds available to all. Being part of this effort is an
opportunity iSEC does not take for granted. TrueCrypt is, as others have said,
&quot;too important to have this little transparency&quot;. iSEC is excited to help
bring more trust and transparency to TrueCrypt!</p>
