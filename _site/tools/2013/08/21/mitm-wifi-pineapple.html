	<h2>Man-in-the-Middling Non-Proxy Aware Wi-Fi Devices with a Pineapple</h2>
    <h6>21 Aug 2013 - Anson Gomes</h6>
</div>

<div lang="en" class="post">
<p>Every security professional has to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) network
communication at some point in their career. This can be challenging in
situations where the device or application does not allow the user to specify
a proxy server. The only way to monitor this sort of communication is to
intercept the traffic flowing through the device&#39;s Internet connection, most
commonly a wireless Access Point (AP). Getting this setup working correctly
can be difficult, as it depends on a number of factors, including having the
right hardware and properly configured software. There are various blog posts
which demonstrate how to create an AP and set up a DHCP server, but few go
into the nitty-gritty details of the entire process for middling network
communication.</p>

<p>This blog article details the steps I took to create this setup in order to
perform MiTM analysis on a custom black-box device. For my setup, I used
Ubuntu and the <a href="http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple">Wi-Fi
Pineapple</a>.  </p>

<h3>What is the Wi-Fi Pineapple?</h3>

<p>You can think of the Pineapple as a highly configurable router. It sets up a
wireless AP and a DHCP server. My reasons for choosing the Pineapple were for
its compatible hardware and easy to use software configurations; both of which
are necessary for setting up a working AP. The Pineapple is built using the
<a href="http://www.data-alliance.net/servlet/-strse-640/Alfa-Hornet-dsh-UB-Atheros-AR9331/Detail">Atheros
AR9331</a>
chipset supporting <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/MasterMode">Master
mode</a> and uses
<a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> for setting up the 802.11 b/g/n wireless
router. Out of the box, the Pineapple has a number of tools which help in
wireless security testing and penetrations tests such as
<a href="http://www.wirelessdefence.org/Contents/KARMAMain.htm">Karma</a>,
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/dnsspoof">DNSSpoof</a>, and
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/urlsnarf">URLSnarf</a> among others. All of these are
controlled via a web application which is accessible on the Pineapple. These
tools and features can also be accessed via SSH. The current version is Mark
IV and is sold for only $99.99, so the Pineapple is a cheap and easy to use
device for wireless assessments.</p>

<h3>How to Man-in-the-Middle Communication using a Pineapple</h3>

<p>Now that you know what the Pineapple is, we&#39;ll look at how to use it to MiTM
network traffic.</p>

<p>The diagram below represents my setup to MitM network traffic between a device
and a server on the Internet which can be understood as:</p>

<ol>
<li>The testing laptop is connected to the Internet via the Ethernet port.</li>
<li>The testing laptop is also connected to the Pineapple via the Wi-Fi
adapter.</li>
<li>The target device is configured to talk to the Pineapple.</li>
<li>All monitoring and interception happens on the testing laptop.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../../images/anson/pineapple_set_up_617x206.jpg" alt="Pineapple setup"></p>

<p>Note: You can modify this setup to suit your needs, e.g. connect the Pineapple
to the laptop via the Ethernet port and connect the laptop to the Internet via
Wi-Fi.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Setting up the AP and DHCP service</h3>

<p>Since the Pineapple sets up an AP and a DHCP server out of the box, our task
of setting up a working AP is handled by the Pineapple itself. The default AP
created by the Pineapple is called <strong>pineapple 19:3e</strong>. It also has an IP
address of 172.16.42.1 and leases IP addresses in the range of 172.16.42.0/25.
The adjacent screenshot of an iPad (used for demonstration) connected to the
Pineapple depicts this information. You can change these settings by SSHing
into the Pineapple and by modifying its configurations.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/anson/network_settings.jpg" alt="Network Settings"></p>

<p>You can now connect a device to the AP created by the Pineapple; however, the
device will not be able to connect to the Internet because we haven&#39;t
connected the Pineapple to the Internet. To do that, we&#39;ll need to set up
Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) on our laptop by forwarding all traffic from
the Pineapple&#39;s Wi-Fi adapter to its Ethernet adapter (or vice versa depending
on your setup). Then, we&#39;ll be able to monitor and intercept the traffic
flowing through the Pineapple.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Configuring the Pineapple to connect to the Internet (Setting up ICS)</h3>

<p>We can set up ICS with a bit of networking and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables">IPTables</a> magic. Enabling ICS
between the two physical interfaces (i.e. Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapter on the
tester&#39;s laptop) involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enabling IP Forwarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a route between the interfaces for forwarding the network traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Routing network traffic between the interfaces through a proxy via IPTables.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This task of setting up ICS is again made easy by the Pineapple. There is a
script called <a href="http://wifipineapple.com/mk4/scripts/wp4.sh">wp4.sh</a> available
from the Pineapple website which sets up the ICS between the interfaces. A
full list of commands is available towards the end of the article which
includes the commands from the wp4.sh script in addition to a few others to
MiTM network traffic. For the wp4.sh script to execute successfully, you will
need some knowledge of the network configuration of your system. You can get
this information by running ifconfig on the laptop. Download the script from
the website and execute it inputting the necessary configuration so that it
executes successfully as seen in the screenshot below.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/anson/successful_execution_of_the_wp4.jpg" alt="Executing wp4.sh"></p>

<p>Once you have ICS configured, the device connected to the Pineapple will be
able to access the Internet. As mentioned earlier, the Pineapple comes with a
plethora of tools which can be managed via a web interface. This web interface
also lists all the devices that are connected to it and also has a logging
functionality which can be really useful.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/anson/devices.jpg" alt="Device list"></p>

<p>You can also monitor the traffic flowing through the Pineapple using packet
capture software such as <a href="http://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark</a> by sniffing on
the Wi-Fi adapter of the laptop.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/anson/monitoring.jpg" alt="Monitoring with Wireshark"></p>

<p>Now that you can monitor the network traffic flowing through the Pineapple,
let&#39;s look at how to send this traffic to a proxy server so that we can
actively modify the data flowing across the wire.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Routing network traffic through a proxy server via IPTables</h3>

<p>If we were using a device such as an iPad for MitM communication this would
have been easy; just add a proxy server to the network settings of the device
and you would be in the middle of the network communication. However, since we
cannot modify or set the proxy settings on a non-proxy aware device our task
is a little more complicated. We can use IPTables rules to MitM the network
communication flowing from such a device through the Pineapple. The following
IPTables rules will redirect all traffic for ports 80 and 443 to port 8080.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080

iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080

iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080

iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can now have a proxy server running on the loopback (127.0.0.1) interface
of the laptop and intercept traffic on port 8080. Using this setup we can make
changes to the network traffic on the fly as shown in the screenshot below
(where the iPad is used just for demonstration):</p>

<p><img src="../../../../images/anson/burp.jpg" alt="Burp screenshot"></p>

<p>Note:Intercepting SSL traffic from the embedded device could be a little
tricky and difficult based on the security configuration of the device. You
will have to install a SSL certificate (from the proxy server) into the
trusted root store of the device. This procedure will be device specific.</p>

<p>The example above redirects HTTP.  If you&#39;re not sure what the device is
talking, using the packet capture software to determine the ports, and
redirect the correct ones.  Make sure that the proxy server can handle the
protocol used by the device; <a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/proxy.html">Burp</a> is
an HTTP proxy whereas
<a href="http://www.contextis.com/research/tools/canape/">Canape</a>,
<a href="http://intrepidusgroup.com/insight/mallory/">Mallory</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/tcpprox">tcpprox</a> can intercept raw TCP
communication.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s much easier to MitM the network communication of opaque devices than it
may seem.</p>

<p>The complete list of commands to MitM network traffic using the Pineapple is
listed below. These commands have been taken from the wp4.sh script of the
Pineapple and include the additional IPTables rules for proxying the network
communication on ports 80 and 443 by redirecting it to port 8080. Replace the
variables with your setup&#39;s configuration data.</p>
